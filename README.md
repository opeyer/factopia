# factopia

Factopia is a website with which people can submit, upvote, and react to facts, or report them as not being factual or misleading if need be.

This application was developed followinging [Jonas Schmedtmann's Crash Course: Build a Full-Stack Web App in a Weekend! tutorial on Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/course/full-stack-crash-course/), though I intend to add quite a few personal features to make it more my own.
