# factopia

Factopia is a website with which people can submit, upvote, and react to facts, or report them as not being factual or misleading if need be.

This application was primarily developed following [Jonas Schmedtmann's Crash Course: Build a Full-Stack Web App in a Weekend!](https://www.udemy.com/course/full-stack-crash-course/) tutorial on Udemy.com, but I intend to personalize the application and develop a few new features of my own.
