# factopia

Factopia is a website with which people can submit, upvote, and react to sourced facts, or report them as not being factual or misleading if need be.

This application was primarily developed following [Jonas Schmedtmann's Crash Course: Build a Full-Stack Web App in a Weekend!](https://www.udemy.com/course/full-stack-crash-course/) tutorial on Udemy.com, with a few personalizations and minor features of my own.

You can view my certificate for completing the course [here](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-131e586f-6f9b-4013-ae8f-c8432c7c5e34/).
